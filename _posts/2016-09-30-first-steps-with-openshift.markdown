[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) is a PaaS built by [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/) on with Docker and Kubernetes. What does all that mean? Let's start with some definitions:
- PaaS is ["Platform as a Service"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), a category of cloud services which allows developer to build, run and deploy applications without spending too much time on maintaining infrastructure.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a "containerization platform" - thing which allows you to deploy your apps inside a container and not inside a VM.
- [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) is tool which allows you to manage your containers and automate your deployment.
